neoliberal policy-makers urged governments to transfer state-owned land to private ownership, arguing that this would increase productivity by stimulating land markets and promoting private investment in land-based development. Asked, in effect, to organize their own dispossession, some government officials took the opportunity to acquire state-owned land for themselves, or their relatives and associates, in their capacity as private citizens.

forests, mined soil and valuable minerals, and left the land less productive than they found it.  ... researchers and policy analysts are beginning to advocate community-led land reform as a preferable alternative\citep{berry2009}

the effects of court practice.
