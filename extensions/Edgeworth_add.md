# Edgeworth Box diagrams

## Isoquant Edgeworth box plots

The model could be visualized on an Edgeworth Box isoquant diagram, and useful because it shows the effective $w/r$ (isocost lines) faced on unenclosed and enclosed sites.  

In our model thus far $G(T,L) = \theta \cdot F(T,L)$  which means that the technological change following enclosure is Hicks Neutral.  We find however that privately enclosed plots will tend to be more labor intensive because farms in that sector face, on the margin, a higher wage/rental. This is a source of misallocation because it leads to 'labor expulsion' and further crowding of the now diminished unenclosed sector. 

Some have argued, in Boserupian fashion, that a transformation toward more exclusive property rights might facilitate the adoption of more labor-intensive technologies (e.g. irrigated crops, tree crops).  Otsuka and Place {cite}`otsuka2014` have a diagram describing such a situation that our model might be allowed to encompass diagram.  The model suggests that while that may indeed be socially optimal to this, it may or may not be in private actors' incentives to do this:
