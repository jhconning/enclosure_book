## Social vs Private Enclosure decisions

These notes based on conversation 10/27/20.  Some of the discussion further down maybes/enclosure_mode.bit incomplete (it focuses on earnings from land but a bit vague on what happening to labor.)

### Social Planner

From our earlier analysis and normalizing  $F(\bar T,\bar L)= 1$ then the social planner decides the fraction of lands $t_e$ to enclose to maximize:

---



$$
\theta F(t_e,l_e)+F(1-t_e,1-l_e)-ct_e
$$


Starting from any $t_e$ it pays to increase enclosure when


$$
(\theta - 1) F_T + (\theta - 1) F_L\cdot \frac{dl_e}{dt_e} \ge c
$$


In words, it's worth enclosing the next unit of land if the resulting expected *increase* in output exceeds enclosure costs.

### Private enclosure decisions

#### Outside claimant

When the outside claimant pays *c* and encloses land they can then turn around and rent it out.  So they just compare


$$
\theta F_T\ge c
$$


This points to the possibility or excessive enclosure.  The planner cares about the *increase* in output, whereas the outside claimant cares only about how much they will earn from the land after enclosure.  They don't care that in the process they're displacing use-rights holders who lose access to the land and hence lose $F_T+F_L\cdot \frac{dl_e}{dt_e}$  . The new claimant does however put to labor to work on the land and they'll earn $\theta F_L\cdot \frac{dl_e}{dt_e}$

Another way to put this is that enclosure will be excessively high when:


$$
\theta F_T \ge (\theta - 1) F_T + (\theta - 1) F_L\cdot \frac{dl_e}{dt_e}
$$


or 


$$
F_T \ge  (\theta - 1) F_L\cdot \frac{dl_e}{dt_e}
$$


What this says is that the gain in wages the workers now earn by working on enclosed lands fall short of the land use-rights they lose due to enclosure.  The Samuelson's 1974 paper {cite}`samuelson1974`  pointed out that when $\theta=1$ labor would clearly lose out. 

#### Formalizing Existing use-right holder

What if the claimant is an existing use-rights holder, a member of the existing community.    Two interesting cases to contrast here, depending on whether the privatizer maintains or loses access to the commons.  

##### Privatizer maintains access to commons

If they maintain access then they're basically acting like an outside claimant.  They gain $\theta F_T$ but still have access to their share of commons land so in effect they lose very little there.  So they basically compare $\theta F_T>c$

####  Privatizer loses access to commons

If on the other hand the person who withdraws their share of land to enclose it then loses access to remaining common lands then they gain $\theta F_T$ but they lose $F_T$.  So they compare


$$
(\theta-1)F_T>c
$$
