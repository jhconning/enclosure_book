# Modeling formalization

One interpretation of the underlying friction/insecurity is that individuals who have customary tenure may fear that if they leave the community, say to get a manufacturing job in the city, they will lose their customary use-rights

This creates an inefficiency because:

$$
MPL_C + MPL_C \cdot \bar T_i = APL_C = MPL_M
$$


But suppose that when they move to the city they have probability $\mu > 0$ of retaining their use-rights and they, in effect, lease out those rights and get paid the associated rents.  Then the relation becomes:

$$
MPL_C + MPL_C \cdot \bar T_i = MPL_M + \mu MPT_C \cdot T_i
$$

'Formalization' might be thought of as raising $\mu$.  Complete formalization at $\mu = 1$ eliminates the inefficiency.
