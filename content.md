# The Enclosure Projects


This is a jupyter book of the content of a couple of related ongoing projects on property rights 'enclosure' and the transformation of customary tenure.  We are writing this up as papers in Baker and Conning {cite}`baker2020`

All the content is based on markdown files and jupyter notebooks[^footn] combined together into a navegable book using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) which in turn builds on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

[^footn]: On pages with executable code, click on the binder (rocket) or google colab icon (top right of those pages) to launch the notebook or code on a cloud server. An example notebook is  [here](./notebooks/enclosure_model.ipynb)
