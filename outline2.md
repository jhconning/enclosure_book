# Introduction

#### Our framework

- Broad enough to hang
- 

### Misallocation

[misallocation.md](misallocation.md)



#### Historical Context



#### Customary

- Land tenure
  - rules and norms governing rights of access, use, and transfer of lands
  - "rooted in the practices of past generations"  ... "they stem from and are sustained by the living .... they are community-based property systems (Wiley 2008)"

- informal, traditional, indigenous
- statutory usually introduced in the colonial period.
- Concern arises because dual (or multiple) legal systems co-exist... statutory law alongside
  - presence of multiple systems can contribute to insecurity and conflict
  - Finding ways to recognized existing rights and integrate the two a challenge.
- As customary systems undermined (or chipped away) leave void that statutory systems unable to fill... 

- People lose rights critical to their livelihoods..
- Pressure accelerating
  - Companies seek land
  - Forest resources commoditized 
- REcognizing existing, registering as statutory rights  

- Community or individualized  

- "Those who are aware of their rights often lack the financial and technical support necessary to assert and use those rights effectively."
- "Local land rights remain vulnerable to capture by elites who often enjoy state support on the grounds that they have greater capacity than smallholders to bring unused resources into production."



#### A conceptual framework

- Not meant to be exhaustive
  - for example not really: xxx (though straightforward extension)
  - {cite}`deininger2003`

## Africa

- Africa vast land and natural resources, home to immense biodiversity.
- Variety of land property regimes but customary law important in many regions. 



- Although historically a "land-abundant region" and land institutions evolved under such conditions, today's PRS are adapting in the face of rising population, new technologies and market opportunities.  
  - Great opportunities for wealth creation, broad based growth 
  - but failure to adapt threatens resources
    - overexploitation, degradation
    - loss of natural resources and habitats
  - fears of land grabs and scramble for property rights
    - conflict and costly rent-dissipation
    - loss of access to land by weaker stakeholders

  Food prices and conflict \cite{mcguirk2020}
  
- Policy challenges:
  - The messy scramble is on
  - How to build/strengthen land laws and governance and administration.  Catch up.
  - recognize, empower, formalize and transform without making problems worse.

### Purpose of this paper

- Analytical survey of economics literature on customary tenure and its transformation with emphasis on Africa
  - emphasize costly nature of PRs delineation and enforcement.  Exclusion and transferability.
  - In practice many decisions to create, protect, and/or contest PRs are private/decentralized.
    - Framework flexible to do both
  - general equilibrium spillovers and strategic complementarities in transitions. 
  - rent-seeking and political economy 

### Definitions and Extent

- customary/communal vs statutory-legal
- Importance of customary in Africa; but also important to recognize vast size and heterogeneity
- land through lens of "wealth, control, meaning."  
  Our emphasis on wealth but others also important consideration.
- local or corporate governance
  - often individuated use-rights but transfer and other rights often limited/subject to community sanction
- Even in states with strong statutory-legal, localities have significant say over land use
  - local ordinances; coop building rules, etc.
  - forbearance (i.e. local leaders often choose to not enforce statutory legal regulations)
  - so everywhere a mix.
  - determined by economic and political factors 
- Wiley's statistics on extent and recognition {cite}``aldenwily2018`
  - Recognition
  - Formalization
  - Transformation

### Claimed advantages and disadvantages

- Claimed advantages
  - Local, adaptive, responsive. Low cost. Secure.
  - The PRs already exist and should be recognized.
  
- Claimed criticisms
  - insecurity may lead to 
    - under or over investment.
    - Inability to attract outside finance/investors
    - misallocation due to imperfect land lease markets
  - Open Access and Tragedy of the Commons
  - Misallocation within sectors
  - Misallocation between sectors
  - Inability to transfer

  - Fragmentation 
  
  US reservation lands \cite{leonard2020a}
  
- Reality
  - Messy transformations are already underway everywhere.
  - Formalization programs playing catch up. 
  - Programs may help, but could also possibly make things worse.
    - Opening the door to conflict and inefficient race for PRs.  
    - Excess privatization of public/community resources.

### Examples of transformation/formalization

Transformations underway everywhere but useful to study past experiences.

- Outside of Africa
  - England:  800 years of enclosures
  - Frontiers: Spontaneous order.. Squatters, pre-emption.
  - Mexican Ejidos: 
  - Colombian Sierra:
- Historically
  - Cocoa boom in Ghana
  
  \cite{hill1961}
  
  - Coffee in Kenya
- Modern
  - Rwanda, Ethiopia
  - Tanzania
  - Ghana
  - Botswana

## Review: the evolution and transformation of PRs  

Most are theories built around idea that when land is abundant benefits of enclosing fall short of costs, but with rising population, new technology, markets a rising return to better regulation to capture rents. 

- Property Rights School
  - Coasian bargains
- More conflict based theories
  - the more powerful change the rules to their advantage
  - land grabs
- ETLR:
  - Demand and Supply of PRs
  - "Contracting for Property Rights"

#### Costs of enclosing

### Rental Markets

\cite{singirankabo2020}  'Land Borrowing'

PRs refroms in China activated the land market \cite{chari2020}

\7.   What are PRs (institution to prevent/resolve conflicting claims over scarce resource)

\8.   Contrast to customary (corporate) to statutory legal

1. Large     Part of the world under customary tenure. Extent around the world {cite}`aldenwily2018

2. 1. Rising      recognition by states.
   2. Co-exist
   3. Even      where legal prevails, what you can or cannot do 

​                               i.   Coops

​                              ii.   Modern shareholder corporations

1. Property     Rights are costly

2. 1. private      and public costs. 
   2. PR      system aspect of a public good. 

3. Frames     for understanding: Wealth, Control, Meaning

4. 1.  

5. Critiques     of 

6. Briefly:     Why and how property systems evolve

7. 1. When      land abundant and/or technology and markets thin...costs of 
   2. Capture      the rents from gains to trade and technology, rising scarcity

​                               i.   induced institutional and technological change..

1. 1. Rent-seeking..      Land grabs.

2. Important     historical transformations from 'customary'

3. 1. England,      Europe.. 
   2. Even      United States (squatting, speculating)
